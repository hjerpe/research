# Research Notes: Knowledge Graph GBT Movie Ratings

This file documents the research process for the following question:

> Does augmenting a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (e.g., XGBoost) with topological features and embeddings derived from a Knowledge Graph improve rating prediction accuracy compared to using only raw metadata features?

## Initial thoughts

- I'll start by searching for papers and articles on this topic.
- I'll look for existing implementations or datasets that I can use.
- I will need to understand what "topological features" and "embeddings" are in the context of knowledge graphs.
- I'll document my findings and the sources I consult.
