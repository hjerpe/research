# Work Log: AI Coding Assistants Research

## Initial Approach and Hypotheses

My initial plan was to conduct a straightforward feature-by-feature comparison of the three mentioned AI coding assistants: "Claude Code for Web", "Codes Web", and "Jules". I hypothesized that they would be direct competitors with similar feature sets, primarily differing in their underlying models and UX.

## Research Process and Tools Used

1.  **Tool:** `google_search`
2.  **Queries:**
    *   `Claude Code for Web`
    *   `"Codes Web" programming assistant`
    *   `Jules coding assistant`
3.  **Methodology:**
    *   I started by searching for each term to gather primary sources and official documentation.
    *   For "Claude Code for Web", I found the official Anthropic pages, which provided a good overview of its agentic nature and customization through `CLAUDE.md` files.
    *   The search for "Codes Web" was less direct. It led me to a GitHub repository for a project named "Chara Codes", which seemed to match the description of a web-focused coding environment. This was a key finding, as "Codes Web" is not a widely known standalone product name.
    *   The search for "Jules" returned official Google blog posts and the product's homepage, clearly outlining its asynchronous nature and integration with the development workflow through a CLI and an upcoming API.
    *   After gathering the initial data, I synthesized the information into a comparative table to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.

## Key Learnings and Pivots

*   **Pivot:** My initial assumption that all three were direct competitors was nuanced. "Codes Web" (Chara Codes) is highly specialized for frontend development, whereas "Claude Code" and "Jules" are more general-purpose coding assistants.
*   **Discovery:** The asynchronous nature of Jules is a significant differentiator, positioning it as a background collaborator rather than a real-time pair programmer.
*   **Discovery:** The customization of Claude Code via `CLAUDE.md` files and plugins is a powerful feature for teams that want to enforce specific coding standards and workflows.

## Final Summary

The research process was effective in not only gathering the requested information but also in clarifying the market positioning of each tool. The initial ambiguity around "Codes Web" was resolved through careful analysis of the search results. The final comparison table accurately reflects the distinct advantages and use cases for each of the three AI coding assistants.
