# Research Agent

Async research agent system for conducting structured, templated research across multiple domains.

## Overview

This repository contains automated research sessions conducted by AI agents. Each directory represents an independent research project with findings, code experiments, and validations.

## Research Types

1. **Technical/Coding** - Implementation research, debugging, library comparisons, architecture patterns
2. **Product/Market** - User needs, market trends, competitor analysis, feature validation
3. **Academic/Deep-dive** - Complex topics, papers, learning new domains
4. **Quick Fact-checking** - Specific information, verification, source finding
5. **Strategy & Operations** - Organizational design, AI/data roadmaps, Ways of Working, value prioritization

## Structure

Each research session creates a timestamped directory:

```
research/
└── YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-topic-slug/
    ├── README.md              # Main research document
    ├── question.md            # Original research question
    ├── metadata.json          # Session metadata
    ├── sources.md             # Detailed source list
    ├── experiments/           # Code experiments
    └── artifacts/             # Downloaded docs, PDFs
```

## Status

🚧 **In Development** - Phase 0: Researching trigger mechanisms

## Inspiration

Inspired by [Simon Willison's research repository](https://github.com/simonw/research).
